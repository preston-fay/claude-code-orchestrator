      ## Optimization Problem
      - **Objective:** {{OBJECTIVE}}
      - **Decision Variables:** {{VARIABLES}}
      - **Constraints:** {{CONSTRAINTS}}

      ## Getting Started
      ```bash
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      orchestrator run start --intake intake.yaml
      ```

next_steps:
  - "Install optimization solver (PuLP/Gurobi)"
  - "Place input data in data/raw/"
  - "Define optimization objective in intake.yaml"
  - "Start workflow: `orchestrator run start --intake intake.yaml`"
