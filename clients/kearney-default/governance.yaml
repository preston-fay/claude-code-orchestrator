# ==============================================================================
# USAGE NOTES
# ==============================================================================

# This configuration defines Kearney's baseline quality standards.
#
# Client configs inherit these defaults and override specific fields:
#
# Example client override (only overriding what differs):
# ```yaml
# client_name: "High Security Client"
# quality_gates:
#   require_security_scan: true  # Override: client requires security scanning
#   min_test_coverage: 90         # Override: higher coverage requirement
# compliance:
#   pii_handling: "strict"        # Override: GDPR compliance needed
#   frameworks:                   # Override: add GDPR to SOC2
#     - "SOC2"
#     - "GDPR"
# # All other fields inherit from kearney-default
# ```
#
# See clients/README.md for full documentation on overriding defaults.
