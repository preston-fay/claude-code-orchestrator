  name: "Golden Path - Customer Demand Forecast"
  type: "analytics_forecasting"
  domain: "retail"
  description: |
    Demonstrate the full Ready-Set-Code orchestration flow with a realistic
    analytics project: forecasting weekly product demand by region and
    producing an executive KPI dashboard.

goals:
  primary:
    - "Forecast weekly demand by product category and region for next 12 weeks"
    - "Generate executive KPI dashboard spec with 4 key metrics"
    - "Achieve MAPE < 15% on held-out test set"
  secondary:
    - "Demonstrate Ready-Set-Code end-to-end orchestration"
    - "Showcase checkpoint artifacts and governance gates"
    - "Generate comprehensive documentation for handoff"

notes: |
  This golden path project is designed to demonstrate the full capabilities
  of Ready-Set-Code. It includes:

  - Realistic analytics workflow (forecasting + dashboard)
  - All standard phases enabled
  - Governance gates configured
  - Sample data included

  Use this as a starting point for real client engagements. Copy this file,
  update the project details, and replace the sample data with client data.
